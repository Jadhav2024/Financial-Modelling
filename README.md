The feasibility of the smart lock system lies in the short-term future horizon of 2 to 3 years, as existing technologies have been developed in biometric authentication, IoT technologies, and AI-driven applications for security. Strong demand is observed in the current market trend in smart home products, as the required technologies are commercially available and are increasingly becoming cost-effective. Thus, the system can be developed, tested, and hit the market in that time frame with a well-defined development plan.
